For most girls, they are so annoyed about what to wear before they get out of the house. They want to make themselves look stunning, as the choice is so hard to make, they will spend a lot of time, then they are always late for the date or the work time. In order to get rid of this problem, a girl chose only one style every day.
The girl was from America, and she worked in a fashion company. Before she went to work in the morning, she had to struggle what to wear, which made her be late for company. Then she decided to wear the same clothes as her working style every day. Now she has done this for three years.
Actually, many successful people do the same things, such as Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerberg, who kept the same style no matter where they showed up. They believed that it could save them more time to focus on job. Before students go to college, they dress school uniforms, so there will be no comparison. But in the private hours, we can choose many styles, which helps to keep us the different moods.
